<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Yes, Crawlbot supports both sitemaps (<code>sitemap.xml</code>) or the gzipped equivalent (e.g. <code>sitemap.xml.gz</code>) as seed URLs. Crawlbot will pursue all links contained within the sitemap — including other sitemaps — in adherence to any crawl restrictions (patterns, regular expressions, hops or other constraints) that may be in place for your crawl.</p>
