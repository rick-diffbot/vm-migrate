<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Diffbot has an intelligent caching layer based on numerous factors, among them site reliability and responsiveness, content update frequency, popularity and type of content. The primary goals of this caching are overall API performance and to prevent overwhelming popular sites with requests for infrequently or consistent content.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing problems with cached data, please contact <a href="mailto:support@diffbot.com">support@diffbot.com</a> with details and to discuss potential ways to bypass cached results.</p>
