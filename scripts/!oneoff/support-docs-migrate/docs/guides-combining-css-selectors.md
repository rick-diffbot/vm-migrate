<div class="entry-content">
		<p>By default the Custom API Toolkit will retrieve all content matching your selector. You can Â select multiple items with different selectors if you wish, by comma-separating your selectors.</p>
<p>For example, if you are trying to extract two different types of images, one with the ID <code>#featureImage</code> and perhaps additional images with the class <code>.inlineImage</code>, simply use the selector:</p>
<p><code>#featureImage, .inlineImage</code></p>
<p>Your API results will include all matching images from either selector.</p>
