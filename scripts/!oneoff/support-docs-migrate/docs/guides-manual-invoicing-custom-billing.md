		<p>If you are unable to procure Diffbot services using a credit card, or need other custom billing or vendor approval arrangements made, we are happy to work with you (and/or your purchasing team) to help you start getting web data.</p>
<p>Custom account services or alternative billing arrangements require either a prepaid annual plan (at our Startup or Plus levels), or monthly billing of a Professional or Enterprise account. We are unable to provide custom billing or custom terms for Startup or Plus monthly billing.</p>
<p>For help getting started, contact your Account Manager or simply write <a href="mailto:support@diffbot.com">support@diffbot.com</a>.</p>
