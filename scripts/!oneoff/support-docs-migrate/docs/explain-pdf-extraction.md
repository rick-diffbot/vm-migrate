<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As of September 2016 Diffbot’s Automatic APIs are able to structure content from PDF files.</p>
<p>This is a beta functionality and only available in direct API calls—it is not currently possible to process PDFs while using Crawlbot. (PDF URLs will be successfully processed in Bulk Service jobs.)</p>
<p>Quality of PDF extraction varies and depends significantly on the underlying structure of the document itself.</p>
