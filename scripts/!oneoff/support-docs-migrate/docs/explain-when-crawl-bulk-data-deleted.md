<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Depending on your <a href="http://www.diffbot.com/pricing/" target="_blank">Diffbot plan</a>, inactive crawls will be removed from your account either 14 or 30 days after completion. Bulk jobs will be deleted within ten days of completion.</p>
<p>This includes the extracted data as well as the job meta information (name, settings, etc.).</p>
<p>“Active” crawls are those that are recurring/repeating and that are not in a permanently “paused” state. Currently active jobs will not be deleted or removed from your account. After a recurring crawl completes its final round it will be subject to regular deletion policies.</p>
